# binary heap (max heap) implementation
# All parent nodes must be greater than child nodes
# Contrary to the binary search tree, the left and right order of child nodes do not matter.

#insertion and deltion is O(logN), but lookup is O(n)

#Pros:
#- better than O(n)
#- priority
#- flexible size
#- fast insert

#Cons:
#- slow lookups
